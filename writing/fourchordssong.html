        Lyrics:
    </h3>
    <p>A long time ago my eyes were gold</p>
    <p>I had blue hair and a fiery soul</p>
    <p>And when I danced the sky itself</p>
    <p>Could not contain the joy I felt</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Come with me to the place we played</p>
    <p>After school and every day</p>
    <p>We can chase the sun and swing the swings</p>
    <p>Just like when we were kids</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Way back when my mind was free</p>
    <p>And I could be what I wanted to be</p>
    <p>I closed my eyes and I spread my wings</p>
    <p>Letting go of a million things</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Come with me to the place we played</p>
    <p>After school and every day</p>
    <p>We can chase the sun and swing the swings</p>
    <p>Just like when we were kids</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>Feels like it was yesterday</p>
    <p>But nothing gold can ever stay</p>
    <p>So take my hand and we&apos;ll go on home</p>
    <p>&apos;Cause I don&apos;t want to go alone</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <p>So come with me to the place we played</p>
    <p>After school and every day</p>
    <p>We can chase the sun and swing the swings</p>
    <p>Just like when we were kids</p>
