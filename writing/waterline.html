        The Water Line
    </h1>
    <h3>
        A short story about the dangers of 
    </h3>

    <p>There was a youthful magnificence to the way they ran. &nbsp;Bare feet, flowing hair, and echoes of laughter radiated an elegance unmatched by their parents, who stood, watching from their doorways, as the pair of seven-year-olds left their house for the nearby park.</p>
    <p>Their mother called out, reminding them to be back in time for dinner. &nbsp;She closed the front door to prevent the hot summer air from contaminating their suburban household. &nbsp;The boy and the girl, however, embraced it. &nbsp;They hopped and skipped down the sidewalk, eager to arrive at the fence gates guarding their most cherished location in town.</p>
    <p>To a calloused pair of eyes, the rusted monkey bars, creaky swings, and balding grass might resemble a playground unfit for such children. &nbsp;But where others saw the steps leading to a mere plastic slide, they saw the entrance to a pirate ship cruising through the vast ocean. &nbsp;What they lacked as children in the physical world was overcome with intensely powerful minds that could transform ordinary into thrilling, wood chips into lava.</p>
    <p>He was the first to spot the Water Line. &nbsp;Look, a snake! he mistakenly cried out, pointing at the scaly green material hidden in the grass. &nbsp;She squealed and ran in the opposite direction, while he, with the reckless curiosity of only a boy his age, approached the foreign object. &nbsp;Eventually realizing that she was in no immediate danger, she retraced her steps and stood beside him, peering into the grass. &nbsp;She pointed out that the &ldquo;snake&rdquo; was not moving, bravely poking it with a stick to prove her observation. &nbsp;He agreed. &nbsp;Upon closer inspection, it was revealed to be a harmless garden hose.</p>
    <p>But more curious than the unannounced appearance of the Water Line was, in fact, that water flowed out of it. &nbsp;And not at a trickle&mdash;rather, the rate at which one might use to water plants on the far edge of the lawn. &nbsp;A single thumb carefully placed over the opening could pressurize the stream to a remarkable strength. &nbsp;Realizing this, he quickly bent down and grasped the end of the hose, turning it in her direction. &nbsp;The water lunged at her like an actual snake. &nbsp;A cry of surprise escaped her lips as she attempted to dodge the attack, but her seven-year-old coordination was no match for the liquid&rsquo;s trajectory. &nbsp;A dark splotch appeared in the center of her pale pink shirt as she proceeded to run out of range of the boy&rsquo;s aim.</p>
    <p>The boy stood there clutching the Water Line, overjoyed at his successful prank. &nbsp;I got you! he giggled in delight, watching her run circles from afar.</p>
    <p>Barely! she responded, sticking her tongue out at him. &nbsp;The girl looked down at the wet patch on her shirt and, though she didn&rsquo;t mind getting splashed&mdash;in fact she enjoyed it&mdash;decided it was only fair to get revenge. &nbsp;In her mind, she devised a plan. &nbsp;She would charge toward him like a stampede of dinosaurs. &nbsp;She would tackle him, tickle him, do whatever it took to gain control of the Water Line.</p>
    <p>With the battle cry of a boiling tea kettle, the girl made a beeline for the boy, and by the look on his face, he had not expected such a counterattack. &nbsp;Her fierceness alone caused him to drop the Water Line at his feet and flee. &nbsp;She swooped it up and, planting her feet, used both hands to aim the flow of water at her former attacker.</p>
    <p>The stream traveled no more than a single stride&rsquo;s length before hitting the ground.</p>
    <p>The boy looked back to see what had happened, and he knew immediately. &nbsp;You have to hold your thumb over the top, he called out. &nbsp;The girl fiddled with the opening for a few seconds. &nbsp;He approached her to help, but at that moment she figured it out and aimed the Water Line directly at his head in a playful act of revenge. &nbsp;The stream hit him squarely in the forehead. &nbsp;Take that! she yelled in delight, spraying his face and upper body while he threw up both arms in an attempt to block it.</p>
    <p>Stop&ndash; he sputtered, receiving only a mouthful of water. &nbsp;Within seconds, the boy was dripping from head to toe, a sensation he actually found quite refreshing on this summer evening. &nbsp;When she was satisfied with her revenge, the girl let go of the Water Line and let it fall to the ground at her feet. &nbsp;Now me! she grinned, spreading her arms out.</p>
    <p>That night they skipped back home, hand in hand, soaked to the bone. &nbsp;The setting sun cast a shadow of gold across their bodies. &nbsp;In that moment, their satisfaction stood unmatched by any possible material or worldly presence imaginable.</p>
    <p>The girl felt it first. &nbsp;The headache. &nbsp;Upon waking up, she felt a terrible ringing in her ears followed by a strong and sudden urge to throw up. &nbsp;She rolled out of bed&mdash;luckily, she had the bottom bunk that night&mdash;and staggered two steps before falling to her knees and letting a stomach&rsquo;s worth of green slime escape from her mouth. &nbsp;While she sat there retching, he woke up and heard the same painful ringing. &nbsp;It made his vision go blurry. &nbsp;Grasping the edge of the bunk railing&mdash;he had the top bunk that night&mdash;he made no effort to exit his bed before mimicking her, his vomit traveling over the edge of the bunk bed and splashing onto the ground. &nbsp;The two of them lay there, crumpled, for what felt like hours before their mother discovered them, shells of the children they once were.</p>
    <p>It is far too late to ask what could have avoided this tragedy. &nbsp;If they had decided to play at home that day. &nbsp;If they had resisted the temptations of the Water Line. &nbsp;If they had been anything less than innocent seven-year-olds. &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;If they had gone back to the park that summer and investigated the mysterious origins of their precious Water Line, they would have discovered a plain old garden hose. &nbsp;Yes, a harmless garden hose that ran between blades of grass, from under a nearby fence, along an unnamed road, and out of a small, rusted sewage drain.</p>
