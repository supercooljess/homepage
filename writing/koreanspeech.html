        Translation:
    </h3>
    <p>In my hometown, there is a bakery that I often used to go to with my grandmother. &nbsp;There, there was a huge bread known as gonggal bread. &nbsp;&apos;It&apos;s bigger than all the other bread, but why is it only two dollars?&apos; I thought. &nbsp;It was strange. &nbsp;My grandmother bought me one, and as I excitedly took a bite, &apos;Huh? &nbsp;What is this?&apos; &nbsp;The bread was hollow. &nbsp;At first I expected it to be hard and tasteless, but the more I ate, it became rich and delicious. &nbsp;It was different from what I had originally thought.</p>
    <p>When I was in middle school, I did wrestling, and I was the smallest on my team. &nbsp;When I competed, everyone thought I would lose, and I would always get flipped my my opponents. &nbsp;But I trained diligently every day, and eventually, I won. &nbsp;From that moment on, big opponents didn&apos;t scare me, and whenever I competed, I thought of gonggal bread.</p>
    <p>When I came to high school, I decided to study mathematics, but the math problems became extremely difficult. &nbsp;Math is my favorite subject, but sometimes after several hours I can&apos;t even solve one problem. &nbsp;When that happens, I think of gonggal bread. &nbsp;Though a question looks long and complicated, if you approach it with confidence, you can find a simple answer.</p>
    <p>These days, I have many tests, interviews, and other difficult work. &nbsp;Sometimes before I begin, I am intimidated and want to give up. &nbsp;But if you prepare well and don&apos;t give up, success will surely come. &nbsp;Everyone, when you face hard times, I encourage you to think of gonggal bread.</p>
