    <h1>
        The Cookie Jar
    </h1>

    <p>The blue ceramic jar sat, the centerpiece of the dining room table, its lid nowhere to be found. &nbsp;What had once been filled with heavenly pieces of gooey, chocolately delight now contained the mere dusting of a few crumbs. &nbsp;The signs were clear: a terrible crime had taken place.</p>
    <p>The suspects were gathered into the room and each given a chance to defend their claimed innocence. &nbsp;Among them stood Mama, a woman whose strength&mdash;especially with a slipper in hand&mdash;made up for her lack of height. &nbsp;If she was not the culprit, justice would most definitely be served to whoever was. &nbsp;On her right stood Thomas, the firstborn son. &nbsp;Though his track record suggested this crime was beneath him, there was a devious side to Thomas that was not to be overlooked. &nbsp;But his younger brother, Timmy, was the more likely suspect. &nbsp;He had yet to reach the age of self-control and was a known troublemaker in this household.</p>
    <p>And finally, towering over the rest, stood Papa. &nbsp;His oversized belly was a constant reminder of the man&rsquo;s love for desserts of all kinds. &nbsp;Entire birthday cakes shook in fear at his presence. &nbsp;It would come as no surprise to anyone if Papa had been the thief.</p>
    <p>The only problem: he had an alibi. &nbsp;And so did Timmy, and Thomas, and Mama. &nbsp;The four of them surrounded the empty jar, accusing each other of a crime none of them committed. &nbsp;They were locked in an argument that would end up nowhere. &nbsp;As I watched these events unfold from the comfort of my pink plastic high chair&mdash;which was coincidentally seated just inches from the dessert cabinet&mdash;I brushed a crumb from my cheek, erasing the last trace of those delicious chocolate chip cookies.</p>
